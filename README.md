Task 1
- Get the robot to move in a straight line.
- How could you get it to go at a different speed?

Task 2
- Get the robot to move in a circle
- Is there a way that you can change the size of the circle?

Task 3
- Get the robot to turn around the obstacle

Task 4
- Now we introduce a type of sensor onto the robot. They are called distance sensors and there are two located on the front face of the robot. They are named 'ds_left' and 'ds_right'. When printing out the values of these sensors they will always output 10 until they get close to an obstacle. Then the values will start to decrease.

- Experiment with these sensor values and try and make the robot come to a halt just before an obstacle.
- You may need to use an if statement

- How could you get it to stop closer?

Task 5
- Get the robot to find the exit between walls
- When the robot realises there is an object in front of it, it should start to turn until there is a clear path infront and then move in that direction.
- You may need to use an if statement

Task 6
- There is a new sensor! Now we are introducing a light sensor. This is similar to the distance sensor, there are two of them (i.e a left and right) in the same location as the distance sensors and their values range between 0 and 10. The more light they detect the higher the value the sensor outputs. 
- There are now lights on the robot arena. They have no physical presence, so the distance sensors will not be able to detect them.
- Get the robot to move towards the light

Task 7
- Get the robot to ignore the closet light and drive towards the further light

Task 8
- Get the robot to move towards the light but stop before it
