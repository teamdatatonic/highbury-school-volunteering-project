    left_speed = 10-right_light_sensor
    right_speed = 10-left_light_sensor

    # We wanted the opposite of what was happening for anger.
    # We wanted the robot to move away from the light
    # To do this we inverted the values from the anger code by 
    # taking them away from 10. Then a high number for anger meant
    # a low number for fear, and vice versa.

    # If there was lots of light on the right, we want the left wheels
    #Â to slow down so it turns left - away from the light.
    # Similarly for light on the left of the robot, we wanted the right
    # wheels to slow down.
    
    #Print the wheel speeds
